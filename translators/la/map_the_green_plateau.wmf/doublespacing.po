"of the old plateau. The castle must be quite old and seems to have been "
"built in a foreign style. It’s quite obvious that this is not barbarian "
"craft."

"not discovered our movements yet. Perhaps we have a chance of conquering "
"that mighty building without a bigger fight! However, it is essential that "
"we capture it. It will be the key to our reign over this island!"
msgstr "Speramus, ut Lanissa, quae princeps in castello  imperat, nostris non iam viderit. Si fortunati, magnum aedificium sine caede capiemus. Castellum capiendum est, cum hic locus fuerit principium insulae capiendae."
